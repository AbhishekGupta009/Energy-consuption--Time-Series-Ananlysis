# Time Series Analysis of Energy Consumption
This project analysis of time series data related to energy consumption. The dataset used in this analysis provides historical energy consumption data over a certain period of time, and the goal of this project is to analyze patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data to gain insights into energy usage behavior.
Analysis Steps
Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand the data.
Time Series Decomposition: Break down the time series into its components.
Modeling: Build forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA).
Evaluation: Assess model performance.
Conclusion and Insights: Draw conclusions and provide actionable insights.
Dependencies
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
statsmodels
How to Use
