# Time Series Analysis of Energy Consumption
# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (final_tsa_energy_consumption.ipynb) contains an analysis of time series data related to energy consumption. The dataset used in this analysis provides historical energy consumption data over a certain period of time, and the goal of this project is to analyze patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data to gain insights into energy usage behavior.

# Data
The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:

# Energy Consumption
The amount of energy consumed on that date (in kilowatt-hours or any other appropriate unit).
# Analysis Steps :
# Data Preprocessing
This section involves loading the dataset, handling missing values, and converting the data into a suitable format for time series analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, we explore the dataset visually and statistically to understand its characteristics, such as trends, seasonality, and outliers.

# Time Series Decomposition
Using techniques like seasonal decomposition, we decompose the time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components to better understand underlying patterns.

# Modeling
Here, we build time series forecasting models to predict future energy consumption based on historical data. We may employ techniques such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) depending on the characteristics of the data.

# Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of our forecasting models using appropriate metrics and visualize the results to assess their accuracy and reliability.

# Conclusion and Insights
Based on our analysis and modeling results, we draw conclusions about energy consumption patterns and trends. We may also provide actionable insights for stakeholders or decision-makers based on our findings.
